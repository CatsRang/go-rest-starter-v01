# Go REST API Example Project Context

**SITUATION:** A Go sample starter project serving as a baseline for developers learning Go REST API development

**CONTEXT:** Go-based REST API server using modern libraries and clean architecture:
- **Web Framework:** Echo v4 for HTTP routing and middleware
- **Logging:** Go's native `slog` package for structured logging
- **CLI:** Cobra framework for command-line interface
- **Configuration:** Viper for flexible configuration management (YAML, environment variables)
- **Architecture:** Clean layered architecture with Handler → Service → DAO pattern

**AUDIENCE:** Backend developers new to Go projects who want to understand:
- Go REST API server architecture and patterns
- Integration of popular Go libraries (Echo, Cobra, Viper, slog)
- Clean architecture implementation in Go
- Configuration management best practices
- Structured logging implementation

**LIMITATIONS:** 
- Sample/starter project, not a production-ready template
- Uses in-memory storage for simplicity (no database integration)
- Basic error handling and validation
- Minimal middleware configuration

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:** 
- Understand Go REST API server architecture and design patterns
- Faster Go backend server project setup and development
- Learn integration patterns for common Go libraries
- Grasp clean architecture principles in Go context
